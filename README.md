# Would You Rather Project

This project is part of my Udacity React course.

It creates a simple frontend in React for to play the Would you Rather game.

- Users can add questions that have the following format:
  - Would you rather "option one" or "option two"
- Users can also answer questions that are posted
- When a user answers a question, they will be able to see how many votes each option had
- There is also a leaderboard that will rank users based on the sum of both created and answered questions

The current app functionality relies on a "mock" backend created by Udacity that doesn't handle creating new users, so to log in just select one of the user names that are available.
